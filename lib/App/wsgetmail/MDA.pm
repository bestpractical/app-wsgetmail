=head1 NAME

App::wsgetmail::MDA - Deliver mail to another command's standard input

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $mda = App::wsgetmail::MDA->new({
      command => "/opt/rt5/bin/rt-mailgate",
      command_args => "--url https://rt.example.com --queue General --action correspond",
      command_timeout => 15,
      debug => 0,
    })
    $mda->forward($message, $message_path);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::wsgetmail::MDA takes mail fetched from web services and routes it to
another command via standard input.

=cut

use v5.10;

package App::wsgetmail::MDA;
use Moo;

use IPC::Run qw( run timeout );

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

You can initialize a new App::wsgetmail::MDA object with the attributes
below. C<command> and C<command_args> are required; the rest are
optional. All attributes are read-only.

=head2 command

A string with the executable to run. You can specify an absolute path, or a
plain command name which will be found from C<$PATH>.

=cut

has command => (
    is => 'ro',
    required => 1,
);

=head2 command_args

A string with additional arguments to call C<command> with. These arguments
follow shell quoting rules: you can escape characters with a backslash, and
denote a single string argument with single or double quotes.

=cut

has command_args => (
    is => 'ro',
    required => 1,
);

=head2 command_timeout

A number. The run command will be terminated if it takes longer than this many
seconds.

=cut

has command_timeout => (
    is => 'ro',
    default => sub { 30; }
);

# extension and recipient are currently unused. See pod below.
has extension => (
    is => 'ro',
    required => 0
);

has recipient => (
    is => 'ro',
    required => 0,
);

=head2 debug

A boolean. If true, the object will issue additional diagnostic warnings if it
encounters any trouble.

=head2 Unused Attributes

These attributes were used in previous versions of the module. They are
currently unimplemented and always return undef. You cannot initialize them.

=over 4

=item * extension

=item * recipient

=cut

has debug => (
    is => 'ro',
    default => sub { 0 }
);


# this sets the attributes in the object using values from the config.
# if no value is defined in the config, the attribute's "default" is used
# instead (if defined).

    my ( $orig, $class, $config ) = @_;

        map {
            $_ => $config->{$_}

        }
        qw(command command_args command_timeout debug)
    };

    return $class->$orig($attributes);
};


=head1 METHODS

=head2 forward($message, $filename)

Invokes the configured command to deliver the given message. C<$message> is
an object like L<App::wsgetmail::MS365::Message>. C<$filename> is the path
to a file with the raw message content.

=cut

    my ($self, $message, $filename) = @_;

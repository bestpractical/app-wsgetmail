=head1 METHODS

=head2 build_rest_uri(@endpoint_parts)

Given a list of URL component strings, returns a complete URL string to
reach that endpoint from this object's C<resource_url> and C<resource_path>.

=cut

sub build_rest_uri {
    my ($self, @endpoint_parts) = @_;
    my $base_url = $self->resource_url . $self->resource_path;
    return join('/', $base_url, @endpoint_parts);
}

=head2 get_request($parts, $params)

Makes a GET request to the API. C<$parts> is an arrayref of URL endpoint
strings with the specific endpoint to request. C<$params> is a hashref of
query parameters to send with the request.

=cut

sub get_request {
    my ($self, $parts, $params) = @_;
    # add error handling!
    my $uri = URI->new($self->build_rest_uri(@$parts));
    warn App::wsgetmail::get_logging_timestamp() . " making GET request to url $uri" if ($self->debug);
    $uri->query_form($params) if ($params);
    return $self->_ua->get($uri);
}

=head2 get_request_by_url($url)

Makes a GET request to the URL in the C<$url> string.

=cut

sub get_request_by_url {
    my ($self, $url) = @_;
    warn App::wsgetmail::get_logging_timestamp() . " making GET request to url $url" if ($self->debug);
    return $self->_ua->get($url);
}

=head2 delete_request($parts, $params)

Makes a DELETE request to the API. C<$parts> is an arrayref of URL endpoint
strings with the specific endpoint to request. C<$params> is unused.

=cut

sub delete_request {
    my ($self, $parts, $params) = @_;
    my $url = $self->build_rest_uri(@$parts);
    warn App::wsgetmail::get_logging_timestamp() . " making DELETE request to url $url" if ($self->debug);
    return $self->_ua->delete($url);
}

=head2 post_request($path_parts, $post_data)

Makes a POST request to the API. C<$path_parts> is an arrayref of URL
endpoint strings with the specific endpoint to request. C<$post_data> is a
reference to an array or hash of data to include in the POST request body.

=cut

sub post_request {
    my ($self, $path_parts, $post_data) = @_;
    my $url = $self->build_rest_uri(@$path_parts);
    warn App::wsgetmail::get_logging_timestamp() . " making POST request to url $url" if ($self->debug);
    return $self->_ua->post($url,$post_data);
}

=head2 patch_request($path_parts, $patch_params)

Makes a PATCH request to the API. C<$path_parts> is an arrayref of URL
endpoint strings with the specific endpoint to request. C<$patch_params> is
a hashref of data to include in the PATCH request body.

=cut

sub patch_request {
     my ($self, $path_parts, $patch_params) = @_;
     my $url = $self->build_rest_uri(@$path_parts);
     warn App::wsgetmail::get_logging_timestamp() . " making PATCH request to url $url" if ($self->debug);
